# eureka-to-human
This repository tracks the progress of potentially using eureka to train a task in simulation, port that task to a physical robot, then port that task to a Neuralinked individual. This would allow the training of any skill in simulation to be moved to a human which would be mechanically turked into performing tasks they have never known how to do.
